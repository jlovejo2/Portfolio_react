Contains a description of who I am, what I like to do, and the skills I have. 

## Portfolio	
Contains a list of all my coding & web application accomplishments

## Contact
Is a form one can fill out to contact me if needed 

## Coding Languages Used
* React
* Node.js
* JSX
* Javascript
* Boostrap
* HTML
* CSS

## NPMS & Specialty Libraries
This project was created with:
* NPM axios
* NPM react-bootstrap
* NPM express
* NPM dotenv
* NPM nodeMailer
* animate.css - link - https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/

## Helpful Hints
* the portfolio has three pages: About, Portfolio, Contact
* there are links for all three in top navbar and a button for professional links (github, linkedin, resume)
* portfolio page contains several of my completed projects and has a filtering input bar at the top
* contact form uses nodeMailer to send email and will notify user when email is sent to me

## Specific Changes Made
* updated the whole portfolio to have its front-end rendered and all functionality to be down with react
* added searchable feature to the portfolio table that will search projects for technologies used & by title
* added gifs to the portfolio table for each project
* added functionality that all gifs start playing when they are hovered over
* added a modal that displays when nodeMailer sends email
* added new CSS to the navbar

## Issues With Code
* the gifs all play at once and stay in the frame of the table.  Would like to be able to have them open up to a larger frame so they are easier to view
